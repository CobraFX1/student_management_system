DAY 2 - PROJECT SETUP & BACKEND INITIALIZATION
----------------------------------------------
• Initialized Git repository using: git init
• Created .gitignore file to exclude node_modules, logs, and environment files.
• Made initial commit: "Initial project setup - folder structure and environment ready."
• Created GitHub repository and linked it to local project using:
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/student_management_system.git
• Verified successful push to GitHub with git status.

• Inside the backend folder:
    - Initialized Node.js project with: npm init -y
    - Installed Express for building REST APIs: npm install express
    - Installed Nodemon for automatic server restarts: npm install --save-dev nodemon
    - Created server.js file and wrote base Express setup.

• Configured package.json scripts:
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"

• Successfully ran backend server using:
    npm run dev
  Confirmed output:
    "Server is running on http://localhost:5000"

• Installed MySQL driver (mysql2) using:
    npm install mysql2

• Created database named 'student_management' in phpMyAdmin.
• Created db.js file to establish connection between Node.js and MySQL.
• Linked db.js to server.js and confirmed successful connection:
    ✅ Connected to MySQL database.
    ✅ Server is running on http://localhost:5000

• Tools used today:
    - Command Prompt for backend commands
    - VS Code for editing files
    - XAMPP for Apache and MySQL services

Notes:
- Encountered npm script warning initially (fixed by updating package.json).
- Encountered CRLF/LF warning during git add (harmless, ignored).
- Could not use VS Code terminal due to permission issues; used CMD instead.
